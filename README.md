# Tom Lijding

## Who I am
I am a student currently studying the Master Systems and Control at the Delft University of Technology. I am interested in the intersection of AI, dynamical systems theory and control.

## Beyond tech
In my free time I enjoy cooking, kickboxing and reading. Some highlights include kickboxing at the yearly Albertus Magnus Kickboksgala, organizing a cooking competition for my student association and regular meals with friends where I can subject them to my experiments.
